## About
Just a random fun side-project to learn more about emulation in general.

This can emulate some basic games (not many mappers are implemented) with 
reasonable fidelity.

I tried my hand at audio emulation, and some code is checked in - but it sounds aweful so I'm currently using Blargg's audio library.
Additionally, I grabbed the hqx image processing code for upscaling the rendering.
